Q: Why no Object-Oriented Programming?

A: At this point, Drupal is not OO, so I am trying to keep this module 
not be OO either.

Q: Will this module ever be in OO?

A: Yes.  When I pass about 500 lines or so, I'm going to want to split this
module into separate files.  At this point, I feel it would be appropriate
to make those be classfiles.

At this point, I also intend on building a factory class for this module
and writing tests in SimpleTest.
